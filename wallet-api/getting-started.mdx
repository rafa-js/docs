## Overview

The Wallet API provides whitelabel wallet infrastructure that integrates directly into your application. Users can be onboarded with just email verification, creating a seamless native experience.

Core capabilities:

* **User onboarding** - Email-based account creation
* **Balance management** - Check and track user balances
* **Payment processing** - Send and receive payments
* **Transaction history** - Complete payment records

All wallet functionality operates within your application's interface, maintaining user context and experience.
