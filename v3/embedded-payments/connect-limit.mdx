title: Connect limit
description: 'Default spending limit and how users can change it'
---

By default, connected apps have a daily spend limit (often $10). Users can change this in their account settings.

```text
Users: Manage limit at https://market.handcash.io/my-account/account
```

You can programmatically read limits using spendable balances:

```typescript
import { getInstance, Connect } from '@handcash/sdk';
const sdk = getInstance({ appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID', appSecret: 'YOUR_APP_SECRET' });
const client = sdk.getAccountClient('<AUTH_TOKEN>');
const { data } = await Connect.getSpendableBalances({ client });
console.log(data);
```
