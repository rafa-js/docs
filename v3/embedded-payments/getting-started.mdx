# Embedded Payments

Use the v3 SDK to trigger in-app payments from connected users without leaving your experience.

## Install

```bash
npm install @handcash/sdk
```

## Initialize

```typescript
import { getInstance, Connect } from '@handcash/sdk';

const sdk = getInstance({
  appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
  appSecret: 'YOUR_APP_SECRET',
});
```

## Make a Payment

```typescript
// After completing the Connect auth flow, obtain the user's authToken
const client = sdk.getAccountClient('<AUTH_TOKEN>');

const { data, error } = await Connect.pay({
  client,
  body: {
    instrumentCurrencyCode: 'BSV',
    denominationCurrencyCode: 'USD',
    receivers: [
      { destination: 'nosetwo', sendAmount: 0.01 }
    ],
  },
});

if (error) {
  // handle declined/invalid/insufficient permissions
}
console.log('Payment:', data);
```

## Get Spendable Limits

```typescript
const spendable = await Connect.getSpendableBalances({ client });
```

## Exchange Rates

```typescript
const rate = await Connect.getExchangeRate({ client: sdk.client, path: { currencyCode: 'USD' } });
```

<Note>
If you don't require account connection and just need simple checkout links/QRs, use **Payment Requests** instead.
