# Handcash Connect

Enable users to connect their Handcash wallets to your application, trigger payments, and manage digital items on their behalf. Handcash Connect offers seamless integration of blockchain functionalities, enhancing your application's capabilities and user experience.

## Get Your App Credentials

Before you begin, obtain your application credentials by following the [Getting Started with the Developer Dashboard](/developer-dashboard) guide. These credentials are essential for integrating Handcash services into your application.

## Install the SDK

To start using Handcash Connect, install the SDK via npm:

```bash
npm install @handcash/sdk
```

## Import and Initialize the Module

Import and initialize the SDK using your `appId` and `appSecret`:

```javascript
import { getInstance } from '@handcash/sdk';

const sdk = getInstance({
  appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
  appSecret: 'YOUR_APP_SECRET',
});
```

## Account Access â€“ Overview

There are two main ways of accessing HandCash accounts:

#### <u>The user does not have a HandCash account</u>

In this context, you can redirect the user to HandCash to create a new account.

Alternatively, you can create a new HandCash account for them. Follow the *Account Creation Flow* for more details.

#### <u>The user does have a HandCash account</u>

In this context, you must redirect the user to HandCash to authorize your app. After the user grants permissions to your application, they will get redirected back to your application and you will receive an access token that you can use in the SDK.

Follow the *Authentication Flow* for more details.

## Account Creation Flow

Programmatic account creation is part of the Wallet API. For v3, please follow the Wallet API guide instead: see `Wallet API > Getting Started`.

## Authentication Flow

To access a user's account for making payments and retrieving their profiles, you need them to authorize your app. Here's how the authentication flow works:

### 1. Redirect the User to HandCash for Authorization

Generate the redirection URL using the SDK:

```javascript
const redirectionLoginUrl = sdk.getRedirectionUrl();
// Example: Redirecting in a web application
window.location.href = redirectionLoginUrl;
```

Alternatively, you can compose the URL manually:

```javascript
const redirectionLoginUrl = `https://app.handcash.io/#/authorizeApp?appId=YOUR_APP_ID`;
```

Redirecting the user to `redirectionLoginUrl` will take them to HandCash, where they will be prompted to grant permissions to your app.

### 2. User Grants or Denies Permissions

At HandCash, the user will see a prompt asking them to grant permissions to your app. They can either accept or decline access.

### 3. Handle the Redirection Back to Your App

After the user makes a selection, they will be redirected back to your app's Authorization Success URL or Authorization Failed URL, which you specified in your [app settings](https://dashboard.handcash.io).

* If the user **accepts**, they will be redirected to:

  ```
  <your-auth-success-url>?authToken=<AUTH_TOKEN>
  ```

* If the user **declines**, they will be redirected to:

  ```
  <your-auth-decline-url>
  ```

### 4. Retrieve the authToken and Initialize the User Account

Extract the authToken from the query parameters of the redirection URL. Use this token to initialize the user's account:

```javascript
// Example using Express.js on the server side
app.get('/handcash/success', (req, res) => {
  const authToken = req.query.authToken;

  // Store the authToken securely, e.g., in a session or database
  req.session.authToken = authToken;

  // Initialize the user account client
  const client = sdk.getAccountClient(authToken);

  // Proceed with your application logic
  res.redirect('/');
});
```

**Important:** Keep the authToken secure. Do not expose it in client-side code or logs.

## Custom Redirection Parameters

If you need to pass custom parameters through the authentication process (e.g., to maintain state), you can include them when generating the redirection URL:

```javascript
const redirectionLoginUrl = sdk.getRedirectionUrl({ state: 'xyz' });

// The redirection URL will include your custom parameters:
// https://my-app.com/handcash/success?authToken=<AUTH_TOKEN>&state=xyz
```

## Security Considerations

* **Protect the authToken:** Store the authToken securely on your server. Do not expose it in client-side code or logs.

* **HTTPS:** Ensure that all redirection URLs use HTTPS to protect user data during transmission.

* **Session Management:** Use secure session management practices to associate the authToken with the user's session in your application.

* **Token Expiration:** Be aware that the authToken may expire. Implement error handling to manage token expiration and re-authentication if necessary.

## Summary of the Authentication Flow

1. **Your App Redirects the User:** Redirect the user to HandCash using the authorization URL.

2. **User Authenticates and Grants Permissions:** The user logs in to HandCash (if not already logged in) and grants permissions to your app.

3. **HandCash Redirects Back to Your App:** After authorization, HandCash redirects the user back to your specified success or failure URL, including the authToken if successful.

4. **Your App Uses the authToken:** Use the authToken to initialize the user's account client with the v3 SDK.

5. **Interact with the User's Account:** Utilize the SDK to access user data and perform actions on their behalf.

### Example: Calling Connect APIs

```typescript
import { getInstance, Connect } from '@handcash/sdk';

const sdk = getInstance({ appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID', appSecret: 'YOUR_APP_SECRET' });
const client = sdk.getAccountClient('<AUTH_TOKEN>');

const profile = await Connect.getCurrentUserProfile({ client });
const balances = await Connect.getSpendableBalances({ client });
const rate = await Connect.getExchangeRate({ client: sdk.client, path: { currencyCode: 'USD' } });
```
