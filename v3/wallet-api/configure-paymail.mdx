title: 'Configure Paymail Domain (Optional)'
---

Enable your users' wallets to be addressable by `alias@<yourdomain.com>` from other wallets in the BSV ecosystem by configuring a custom paymail domain.

## Step 1: Add SRV Record

Add an SRV record to your domain's DNS settings with the following details:

- **Type:** SRV Record
- **Name:** `_bsvalias._tcp`
- **Value:** `10 10 443 cloud.handcash.io`

## Step 2: Enable DNSSEC

Enable DNSSEC for your domain. This is typically done through your domain registrar or DNS provider's settings.

## Step 3: Update Paymail Domain

1. Go to the [HandCash developer dashboard](https://dashboard.handcash.io/)
2. Navigate to the Paymail domain settings
3. Update your Paymail domain configuration

After completing these steps, your domain should be properly configured for Paymail use with HandCash Wallet as a Service.

## Example Configuration

Here's an example of how to configure the SRV record using NameCheap.com:
