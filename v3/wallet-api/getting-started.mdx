## Set up

To get started with Wallet API:

1. Create an application in the [Developer Dashboard](/developer-dashboard)

2. Save your `AppSecret` and `AppId` for later use

3. Reach out to [sales@handcash.io](mailto:sales@handcash.io) to enable this feature with your application id

4. Install the Handcash SDK in your project:

```

## Overview

Handcash Wallet Service enables you to create wallets for your users using just email verification. With the Handcash SDK, you can initiate the process of sending a verification code to your user's email address.

Once set up, this wallet allows you to:

* Check balance

* Retrieve transaction history

* Make payments

The key advantage is that users can perform all these actions without leaving your application.
